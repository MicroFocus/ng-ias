# Micro Focus ng-ias

This project is the AngularJS implementation of Identity and Access UX Guidelines (ng-ias), the official CSS 
framework for web applications built by Micro Focus Identity and Access Management Group. These guidelines 
help establish a consistent look and feel among common user interface elements throughout Identity and 
Access Management Group products. This documentation contains several interactive components in addition
to providing guidelines about components, user experience (UX) patterns, and application layout.
